So in this code, we create a SingleLinkedList class that handles linked list operations like inserting and removing nodes from both the front and back. We define a struct Node inside, which holds the data and a pointer to the next node. Methods like push_front and push_back add elements to the start and end of the list, respectively. There's also a function insert that lets you add an element at a specific index, and remove removes a node based on its position. Finally, we got a find function that goes through the list to find the first occurrence of an item.

Here's the output,
